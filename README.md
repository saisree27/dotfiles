# dotfiles
Config I use to setup and customize i3 with Arch Linux. 
## dependencies
* xmodmap, xorg-xrdb
* pywal

I use the command `wal -i /path/to/image` to automatically set colorschemes for zsh, alacritty, neovim, and polybar. Additionally, I disable Alt-R as an i3 mod key so it can be used for firefox navigation. For this to work correctly, the above packages need to be installed.
